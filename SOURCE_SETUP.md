# Build the example from public sources

This package is currently a source preview. To try the included example, download the package and the two native libraries it uses. Keep the directory names shown below so the example can find them. Start by [getting your app's dashboard values](SETUP.md).

```bash
mkdir appy-sdks
cd appy-sdks
git clone https://github.com/appy-to/appy-ios-sdk.git ios
git clone https://github.com/appy-to/appy-android-sdk.git android
git clone https://github.com/appy-to/react-native-appy.git react-native
```

For Android, with an Android SDK and JDK installed:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew :appy-sdk:publishReleasePublicationToLocalRepository
cd ..
```

Set `ANDROID_HOME` to your Android SDK directory if Gradle cannot find it. For iOS, use macOS with Xcode installed. The native source packages retain their MIT license; dependencies retain their separate licenses.

Then follow the [example app setup](example/README.md), which covers platform link configuration, the publishable key and running the example. The example requires an Appy Enterprise app to use the hosted endpoints.

For consumer app integration and the upcoming registry installation, see the [quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) and [full guide](README.md). Registry installation will be documented here after the packages are published.
